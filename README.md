# Tilting Maze Game

A 2D physics-based maze game where you tilt the maze to guide a ball to the goal using gravity.
The challenge is all about precision, control, and understanding how momentum works.

The game uses real-time physics to simulate gravity and collisions, making every movement feel dynamic and slightly unforgiving (in a fun way).

# Context

This project started in 2024 as a college assignment, and honestly… the first version wasn’t great.
The gameplay felt off and the physics were unreliable.

Even so, the core idea was fun, so I decided to come back to it later as a personal challenge: fix what was broken, clean up the mess, and see how much I’ve improved since then.

It has since been refactored and expanded to:

  - Fix physics inconsistencies

  - Improve collision handling

  - Make the gameplay feel smoother and more realistic

  - Prepare the codebase for future features and multiplayer support

This version focuses on correctness, maintainability, and extensibility rather than quick hacks.

# How to Play
Single Player (current version)

A / D → Rotate the maze left or right

← / → Arrow Keys → Rotate the maze left or right

# Your goal is to:

Control the maze rotation

Let gravity move the ball

Reach the finish cell without falling into dead ends

# Future Plans / Roadmap

Planned improvements and features:

  - [x] Progressive Web App (PWA) support 

  - [x] Gyroscope support (mobile tilt controls) - check gyro branch, this is still an unfinished version

  - [x] Timer to measure completion time

  - [ ] Leaderboard to compare best runs

  - [ ] Backend service for storing scores and matches

  - [ ] Simple multiplayer mode (1v1)
